# Remote-Code-Management-Facility
Developed a Client-Server application using the peer to peer communication model. Multiple clients can interact with multiple servers via GUI (WPF Client using Managed C++), by selecting from a list of available servers ●  Clients can upload and download code files to and from the Servers and can request string/file search on the code files hosted by multiple servers.
